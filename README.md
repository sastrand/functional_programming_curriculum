# Functional Programming with Haskell
## A Lab Curriculum for Portland State University

This series of exercises is meant to provide a hands-on introduction to functional programming with Haskell completed in five modules.

Each module provides examples, lecture outline, and exercises for about six hours of class time that includes time for students to complete most or all of the exercises presented.

### Learning Objectives
```
Students who successfully complete this lab will be able to:
    * Describe the key characteristics of the functional paradigm.
    * Define algebraic data types to model useful domains.
    * Identify and program:
        - Head recursion
        - Tail recursion
        - Mutual recursion
        - Multiple recursion
        - Infinite and halting recursion
    * Write small Haskell programs to manipulate lists and trees.
    * Use first-class functions as data values.
    * Use higher order functions, including maps, folds, and composition
    * Write a multithreaded map-reduce application over lists
```
