List comprehensions
------

We saw list comprehensions in Python, and these have the same expressive power.
There we saw them as an alternative to loops, written sometimes more concisely 
and without the need for a sentry variable to count iterations. 

We can also think about them as sets. Their name comes from this idea
and the Axiom of Comprehensions, which can be summarized:

    Given a set A and a predicate P, there is a subset of A whose members are 
    those elements in A that satisfy P.

This view that all sets can be built by sub-setting a larger set with respect 
to some predicate allowed for a new notion of set theory that avoids Russell's Paradox.
(The problem that you can define a set as containing every element that is not 
contained in that set.) In this alternative view, every set is not the result 
of just describing what things are in it, but the result of applying some 
predicate to the set of all things and then only keeping the values that 
return true. [1]

We can build sets this way using the filter function we saw in the last lab.
But, in programming and in set notation, we may want to build a set not just by
sub-setting some larger one but also by applying some operation to each element 
in the result, and this is what a comprehension provides.

For example, if we want a set that is the square of every even, natural number 
from 1 to 10, we could describe the set:

    evenSquares = { x^x | x is an element of [1,2,3,...,10] and x is even}

We can do exactly the same with a comprehension:

> evenSquares = [ x^x | x <- [1..10], even x ]

This works over multiple variables. If we want the cross product of two
lists, we can write a list comprehension to do it:

> crossProd xs ys = [(x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys]

Here we've created every tuple that has an element of x in its first position
and an element of y in its second position. If we further want all values of x 
to be even and all values of y to be odd, we can write:

> evenOddCrossProd xs ys = [ (x, y) | x <- xs, y <- ys, even x, odd y ]

In Haskell the sets we draw from are called *generators* and the predicates
applied to them are called *guards*. So the general format is:

[ <function application> | <generator(s)>, <guard(s)> ]

n which there can be any number of generators and guards. They can be
in any order and will be evaluated from left to right.

------
Ranges
------

We can create a list of sequenced values by writing out the first part of the 
sequence, adding two dots, and then the end of the sequence (though be
warned, this does not always do what you expect with floating point values)

> someEvens = [2,4..42]

Because of Haskell's laziness, these lists can be infinite.

> allEvens = [2,4..]

Try evaluating `allEvens` in ghci.

(CTRL+C will interrupt a running evaluation)

Infinite lists are only so useful on their own. Here are a few
functions to manage them.

If we want just the first so many elements from a list, we can use `take`.

> fiveEvens = take 5 [2,4..]

We can create a new infinite list by repeating a value

> infiniteTwos = repeat 2

Or use `replicate` to repeat a value a set number of times:

> answers = replicate 4 42

Exercises

01. Using a list comprehension, write a function `areaCodes` that takes a
    list of phone numbers in the format "123-456-7890" and returns a list of
    their area codes as strings.

    Here is some test data: 

> phs = ["371-836-3310", "805-834-9912", "851-246-9844", "210-599-4050"]

> areaCodes :: [[a]] -> [[a]]
> areaCodes xs = undefined

> prob1Test = areaCodes phs == ["371","805","851","210"]
> prob1 = do
>           putStrLn ("areaCodes phs = " ++ show (areaCodes phs))
>           putStrLn ("Test = " ++ if prob1Test then "PASS" else "FAIL")


02. Using a list comprehension and a range, write a function `unFizz` that
    will return all the multiples of 5 that are not also multiples of 3 up 
    to a given point.

    So `unFizz 20` should return: [5,10,20]

> unFizz :: Integral a => a -> [a]
> unFizz n = undefined

> prob2Test = unFizz 20 == [5,10,20]
> prob2 = do
>           putStrLn ("unFizz 20 = " ++ show (unFizz 20))
>           putStrLn ("Test = " ++ if prob2Test then "PASS" else "FAIL")


In problems 1 and 2 you can see how to subset another set 
with a list comprehension, but arguably you could implement the same
solutions more clearly by filtering or mapping a helper function 
over the input list.

While this is true for all list comprehensions, some problems, like 
the following three, lend themselves more readily to a solution with a 
comprehension.

For your reference, each will make use of the Cartesian distance
formula to find the shortest distance between two points (x1,y1), (x2,y2):

> cartDist (x1,y1) (x2,y2) = sqrt( (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 )


03. Using a list comprehension, write a function `radar`, that will take a 
    set of points and a reference point and return all the points that are 
    within 4 units of distance from that point.

    Note: `(Ord b, Floating b)` in the type signature tells us this function
    takes a value that is an instance of the Floating typeclass that is also 
    a member of the Ord typeclass. So, no irrationally located boats/planes.

    Here is some test data you can use:

> ourBoat    = (2.0,2.0)
> otherBoats = [(-2.0,1.5),(-1,4.8),(1.2,3.7),(4.1,3.4),(5.9,5.0),(6.1,1.7),
>               (7.3,8.5),(3.0,-1.5),(-1.1,-2.6)]

> radar :: (Ord b, Floating b) => [(b, b)] -> (b, b) -> [(b, b)]
> radar pnts ref = undefined

> prob3Test = radar otherBoats ourBoat == [(1.2,3.7),(4.1,3.4),(3.0,-1.5)]
> prob3 = do
>           putStrLn ("radar otherBoats ourBoat = " ++ show (radar otherBoats ourBoat))
>           putStrLn ("Test = " ++ if prob3Test then "PASS" else "FAIL")


04. ISPs to CDNs

    An Internet exchange point (IXP) is a part of Internet infrastructure where
    multiple service providers (ISPs) connect an endpoint of their network
    to an endpoint of every other ISP's network as well as to special servers 
    that store copies of often-demanded content. These special servers are the 
    endpoints of content delivery networks (CDNs) that do nothing but serve data.

    Netflix developed the first CDNs to store copies of all their content near major
    IXPs and other companies that distribute a lot of data followed.

    In an given IXP, there will be multiple ISPs like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon
    that each want to connect to every CDN, like those maintained by Netflix, 
    Google, and Facebook, as well as to every other ISP.

    Say we line up all the ISPs in a row and all the CDNs in another row and 
    represent their locations on a 2D plane with Cartesian coordinates.

> someISPs = [(1.0,0.0), (1.0,1.5), (1.0,3.0), (1.0,3.5)]
> someCDNs = [(0.0,0.5), (0.0,2.0), (0.0,2.5), (0.0,4.0), (0.0,5.5)]

    Write a Haskell expression to determine how much cable will it take to connect 
    every ISP directly to every CDN.

    We'll assume all connections are made with fully duplex cables, that can
    carry data in both directions.

05. Write a Haskell expression to determine much wire will it take to connect 
    every ISP directly to every other ISP as well as directly to every CDN.

    [FILL IN HERE]


06. If we only needed to connect every ISP to every other ISP, what would be a more
    efficient arrangement of their endpoints?

    [FILL IN HERE]


07. Time permitting, plot coordinates for your proposed arrangements and test them out.
